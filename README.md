# js-30

30 projects in vanilla js.

Each subfolder will contain:

0. Pseudo Code Outline (pseudo.txt)
1. unit testing with jasmine
1. rough draft (first attempt without external resources)
   includes: .html, .css, .js files
1. final draft refactor.

The goal of this project is to improve vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, and Unit Testing skills.

Each rough draft is my attempt at completing the project without help (including CSS).

Unit testing and TDD are used to guide my build process.

Final drafts will be refactored after researching best practices for similar projects online.
